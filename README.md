# BizAssist

BizAssist is an open source Flutter-based template for a business assistant application. It has been designed to use [Firebase](firebase.google.com/) as a backend.

The project had started out with an intent to become a mobile interface for Tally (India's premier accounting software). Over time, it refined to become a focused business assistant application. For more details, check out this blog post announcing the project's release.

The project was developed and tested for Android. Please feel free to contribute and make changes for iOS support.

*Note: The codebase was developed in fast iterations while performing user research. There may be instances where it can be improved and modularized. If you come across such cases and want to contribute improvements, consider opening a PR.*
