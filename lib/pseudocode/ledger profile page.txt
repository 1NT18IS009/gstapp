ledger profile page

from ledger service only we get the info, for each ledger item:

basic view that gets info about that 

- contact
- name 
- address


second view about the vouchers - 

using the ledger id, filter all the variables

payment receipts sales purchase that are filtered on the final one. 

third view - stats 


--------------------------------------

Vouchers - it will take index and record the ledger id, and pass that to the search query to all the 4 screens. 
Alsos need to change the back button on the app. 

Guesture detection = record which tap has happened 

var currentLedger = ledgeritem[index].data.partyname;

GoToVoucher() {
    1) FlatButton(onPressed: () => Navigator.of(context).pushReplacementNamed('/vouchers')
  , child: Text('Go to Vouchers'));
    2) Pass the whereby term for the partyname 
}

Fall back on the service - if whereby is not established, then show all ledgers
